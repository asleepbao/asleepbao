- Iâ€™m @asleepbao, aka Bao Anh Rinne.
- I am the epitome of 'i'm only here for class'.
- For a formal introduction, I am a Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience major from UC San Diego. 
- I plan to work in pharmacology research in the future, although much can change.
- I am a novice coder, and will likely post very little.
